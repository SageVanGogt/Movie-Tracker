# Movie-Tracker

Movie-Tracker is an app designed to display data using the moviedb API.  It has functionality allowing users to view upcoming movies, their description and their overall rating.  Users are also able to select favorites from from the list of movies and view them later under the favorites button. The main goal of this project was to learn about how to use redux, router, TDD as well as gain a better understanding of react.
